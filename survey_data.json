Rather than banning AI completely, I think we should learn how to use it ethically and responsibly. I would want to use AI as a learning aid\u2014for example, to help me understand difficult concepts, brainstorm ideas, or check my work for errors\u2014but I would still write my own original responses and do my own critical thinking. AI should enhance my learning, not replace it. I think it's important to cite when I've used AI and be transparent about how I've incorporated it into my work.",
