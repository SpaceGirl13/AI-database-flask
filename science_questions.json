      "id": 2,
      "question": "What is the function of mitochondria in cells?",
      "answer": "Mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell, producing ATP (adenosine triphosphate) through cellular respiration. They convert chemical energy from food into a usable form for the cell.",

      "question": "Describe the structure and function of DNA.",
      "answer": "DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a double helix molecule that stores genetic information. It contains genes made of nucleotide sequences (A, T, G, C) that code for proteins and traits.",
      "prompt_template": "Explain {question} Include the double helix structure, base pairing rules, and how DNA codes for proteins through transcription and translation.",

    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "What are the main differences between plant and animal cells?",
      "answer": "Plant cells have cell walls, chloroplasts, and large central vacuoles that animal cells lack. Animal cells have centrioles and lysosomes that are rare in plant cells.",
      "prompt_template": "Explain {question} Compare and contrast the structures found in each cell type and explain the functional significance of these differences.",
      "category": "biology"
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "What is Newton's Second Law of Motion?",
      "answer": "Force equals mass times acceleration (F = ma). The acceleration of an object depends on the net force acting on it and is inversely proportional to its mass.",
      "prompt_template": "Explain {question} Include the formula F = ma, provide real-world examples, and explain the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration step-by-step.",
      "category": "physics"
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "Explain the difference between kinetic and potential energy.",
      "answer": "Kinetic energy is the energy of motion (KE = ½mv²), while potential energy is stored energy based on position or configuration (like gravitational PE = mgh).",
      "prompt_template": "Explain {question} Include the formulas for each type, provide examples of energy conversion, and explain the principle of conservation of energy.",
      "category": "physics"
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "What are the three laws of thermodynamics?",
      "answer": "First Law: Energy cannot be created or destroyed. Second Law: Entropy always increases in an isolated system. Third Law: Absolute zero temperature cannot be reached.",
      "prompt_template": "Explain {question} Describe each law in detail with real-world applications and explain what entropy means.",

    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "How does electricity flow in a circuit?",
      "answer": "Electric current flows from high to low potential (voltage) through a conductor. Electrons move through the circuit from negative to positive terminal, carrying energy.",
      "prompt_template": "Explain {question} Include Ohm's Law (V=IR), describe the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance, and explain series vs parallel circuits.",
      "category": "physics"
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "What happens during a chemical reaction when vinegar and baking soda mix?",
      "answer": "An acid-base reaction occurs producing carbon dioxide gas (CO₂), water (H₂O), and sodium acetate. The chemical equation is: NaHCO₃ + CH₃COOH → CO₂ + H₂O + CH₃COONa",
      "prompt_template": "Explain {question} Include the chemical equation, identify the reactants and products, explain why bubbles form, and describe what type of reaction this is (acid-base reaction).",

    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "What is the difference between ionic and covalent bonds?",
      "answer": "Ionic bonds form when electrons are transferred between atoms (usually metal + nonmetal), creating charged ions. Covalent bonds form when electrons are shared between atoms (usually nonmetals).",
      "prompt_template": "Explain {question} Describe how each bond forms, provide examples of compounds with each bond type, and explain the properties that result from each bonding type.",
      "category": "chemistry"

    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "Explain the pH scale and what makes a substance acidic or basic.",
      "answer": "The pH scale (0-14) measures acidity. pH < 7 is acidic (more H⁺ ions), pH = 7 is neutral, pH > 7 is basic/alkaline (more OH⁻ ions).",
      "prompt_template": "Explain {question} Describe the pH scale, explain what hydrogen ions (H⁺) have to do with acidity, and provide examples of common acids and bases.",
