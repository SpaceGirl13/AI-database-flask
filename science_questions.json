      "question": "Explain the process of photosynthesis in plants.",
      "answer": "Plants use light energy (usually from the sun) to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen through the chemical equation: 6CO\u2082 + 6H\u2082O + light energy \u2192 C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086 + 6O\u2082",
      "prompt_template": "Explain {question} Include the chemical equation, the role of chlorophyll, and the two main stages (light-dependent and light-independent reactions). Use clear examples.",

    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "What is Newton's Second Law of Motion?",
      "answer": "Force equals mass times acceleration (F = ma). The acceleration of an object depends on the net force acting on it and is inversely proportional to its mass.",
      "prompt_template": "Explain {question} Include the formula F = ma, provide real-world examples, and explain the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration step-by-step.",
      "category": "physics"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "Describe the water cycle and its main stages.",
      "answer": "The water cycle includes evaporation (water turning to vapor), condensation (vapor forming clouds), precipitation (rain/snow falling), and collection (water gathering in bodies of water).",
      "prompt_template": "Describe {question} Explain each stage in detail: evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection. Include how energy from the sun drives the cycle.",

      "id": 4,
      "question": "What happens during a chemical reaction when vinegar and baking soda mix?",
      "answer": "An acid-base reaction occurs producing carbon dioxide gas (CO\u2082), water (H\u2082O), and sodium acetate. The chemical equation is: NaHCO\u2083 + CH\u2083COOH \u2192 CO\u2082 + H\u2082O + CH\u2083COONa",
      "prompt_template": "Explain {question} Include the chemical equation, identify the reactants and products, explain why bubbles form, and describe what type of reaction this is (acid-base reaction).",
